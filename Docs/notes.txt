Semantic Analysis:
- to ensure declarations and statements in the code is semantically correct (ie. is it compileable)
- utilizes ast and symbol table
- Key tasks performed
    - type checking: each operator has the same operands (eg. double with double) or operand has correct assignmentSD
    - checking semantic errors: type mismatches, undeclared variables, reserved keyword misuse

TODO:
- do semantic anaylsis and phase 4 first
- add panic mode
